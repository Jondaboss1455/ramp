    <p>
      Ramps are inclined surfaces that make it easier to move objects to a higher or lower level. By sloping upwards instead of lifting something straight up, ramps reduce the amount of force needed. The idea is to spread out the effort over a longer distance, making the task less strenuous. Ramps have been used since ancient times; early examples can be seen in the construction of the pyramids in Egypt around 2500 BCE, where they helped transport massive stones. Over time, ramps have been adapted for many uses, from wheelchair access to loading docks, continually proving their value in various practical applications.
